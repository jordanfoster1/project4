		<h2>Fan Votes</h2>
		<p>Here is a comparison of van fotes from Westbrook compared to Harden. You should join the people who voted for Westbrook because they have a right sense of mind. Westbrook is clearly more popular than HArden and even the fans think that our rightfull MVP is Russell Westbrook forsure. On the right, it shows how many first place votes Westbrook got throughout the voting sessions. Wesbtrook has the fans on his side and you should join his side because he's also a helping hand and helps communities out with care. Vote for a MVP who knows what they're on and off the court.</p>
